### Number Guesser

```scribble
Output["Welcome to the Number Guesser!"]
var=secret ["math@random[1-10]"]
var=guess ["<input>"]

if (<var=guess> => <var=secret> and <var=guess> <= <var=secret>) then
    Output["Correct! You guessed the number <var=secret>!"]
else if (<var=guess> => <var=secret>) then
    Output["Too high! The number was <var=secret>."]
else
    Output["Too low! The number was <var=secret>."]
```

### Zombie Battle

```scribble
Output["Welcome to Scribble Zombie Battle!"] 
var=playerName ["<input>"]
Output["Hello, <var=playerName>! Prepare for battle!"]
var=playerHP ["100"]

function["attack"]
    var=damage ["math@random[10-20]"]
    var=zombieHP ["<var=zombieHP>-<var=damage>"]
    Output["You attack the zombie and deal <var=damage> damage!"]
    if (<var=zombieHP> <= ["0"]) then
